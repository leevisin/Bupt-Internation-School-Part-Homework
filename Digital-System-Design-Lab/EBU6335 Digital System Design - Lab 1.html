<h2>Lab 1 - Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) Design</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview &amp; Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>The aim of this set of labs is to introduce the concepts and the advantages
of Computer Aided Design (CAD) to design, simulate and implement digital
circuits on programmable components such as CPLDs (Complex Programmable Logic
Devices) and FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays).</p>
<p> These labs introduce some basic CAD tools using the Intel FPGA Design Solution:
Quartus which also includes a VHDL
simulator (ModelSim) that can be used to give you an insight into the use of programmable
logic. After completing these experiments you should be able to:
</p><ul>
<li>Design and simulate complex logic circuit hierarchies in VHDL.</li>
<li>Implement and download these designs into FPGA using CAD tools;
test the designs you have created.</li>
</ul>
<!--By the end of these four lab sessions you will have the knowledge to build a
medium-sized digital system that solves an arithmetic problem.</p-->
<p>VHDL (Very High Speed Hardware Description Language) will be used throughout
the labs to allow you describe what outputs of a digital circuit are desired
when it is given certain inputs. As VHDL can be readily interpreted by software,
you can use a computer to produce your hardware designs on programmable chips.
This makes designing complex digital circuits much faster, cheaper and, above
all, easier than using discrete physical logic chips (recall your experience
from digital logic design laboratories). You should have learnt basic modeling
skills of VHDL from the lectures.</p>

<h3 id="spec">Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU): Specification</h3>

<p>Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) is a combinational circuit that can perform a
number of different arithmetic and logical operations on the input operands. The
bit widths of the operands are usually the same and the set of operations to be
implemented depend on how the ALU is used in applications.</p>

<p>In this lab exercise, you are asked to design a 8-bit ALU for exactly two
operands using the VHDL language. 
It has two 8-bit input operands (A and B), a carry in bit (C<sub>IN</sub>), a
carry out bit (C<sub>OUT</sub>), a 4-bit function select input (F<sub>sel</sub>)
and a 8-bit main output (Y). 
A block diagram for the ALU is shown below:</p>

<p id="functbl"><b>Function Table</b><br>
Please enter your BUPT student ID to customise the function table for your
design (and it will be different from your classmates):</p>

<p>In subtraction, CIN is usually cleared (i.e. logic 0), but when there is a
borrow (from the less significant subtraction) it will be set (i.e. logic 1).
The ALU should generate a logic 1 at COUT when there is a borrow (e.g. 0011 -
1001). You should note any carry or borrow bits generated by arithmetic
operations are generated at COUT, and CIN means differently in addition,
subtraction and shifting.</p>

<p>
<b>Quality of your VHDL code:</b> keeping a good structure of your VHDL code (e.g.
consistent identation, proper identifier naming, etc.) and writing concise
comments help you and others to understand the VHDL models and codes more
easily. Please spend a minute to check the <a href="http://webprojects.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mtang/EBU6335/lab1.html#rubric">rubric</a> for the assessment of your work.

<h3 id="task1">Task 1: To study and modify the Adder/Subtractor module</h3>
<p>
A VHDL template for 4-bit adder or subtractor (<tt>AddSub.vhd</tt>) has been provided.
This is a classic ripple adder implementation using a chain of full adder (FAs,
<tt>FA.vhd</tt>).
Study the VHDL model carefully and make the corresponding modifications:
</p>
<p>
<input type="checkbox"> Under the comment header block, enter your name in Pinyin and your BUPT student ID. Also write down the date of modification<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Change the entity to make it a 8-bit module<br>

<p>
Barrel shifter shifts an input X to an arbitary number of bits, given by the
other input D. The basic implementation uses log<sub>2</sub> |X| (|X| = the
 bit width of X) levels of multiplexers (MUXes).</p>

will also need a number of other simpler logic gates that can be modelled
directly using conccurrent VHDL statements.
</p>
<p>
The VHDL entity for the ALU (<tt>ALU.vhd</tt>) has been provided. Your task is to design, model and write the architecture of the ALU.</p>
<p>
<input type="checkbox"> Study your <a href="http://webprojects.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mtang/EBU6335/lab1.html#functbl">function table</a> again and draft the block diagram / schematic of your ALU design on a piece of paper<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Under the comment header block, enter your name in Pinyin and your BUPT student ID. Also write down the date of modification<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Declare the set of immediate signals that you may need<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Declare the set of components that you may need<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Write statements to implement functions for logic operations<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Write statements to implement functions for shift operations<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Write statements to implement functions for arithmetic operations<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Write statements to implement any extra function(s) (optional)<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Synthesise the module and fix any errors/mistakes<br>

</p>

<h3 id="task4">Task 4: Lab Board Verification</h3>

<p>
Once the synthesis is completed, you can download your design to the board and
verify the correctness.

The input/output devices are mapped to your ALU as shown below:
</p>

<p>Our demonstrators will help you with the working of the lab board.</p>

<h3 id="videodemo">Demonstration Video</h3>
As part of your submission, you need to prepare a video of 
<b>no longer than 5 minutes</b> 
to demonstrate your design.<br>
The video should contains the following parts:
<ol>
<li>A self introduction - your name, student IDs, our module code and the title
of the lab exercise. <b>Your face must be seen in this part</b>.</li>
<li>The verification on a lab board - exactly 3 different operations plus extra
operation(s) (if any)</li>
<li>A discussion of your design, referring to your VHDL codes.
You should show your knowledge about the circuit designed.
</li>
</ol>
<i>You can simply record different video clips using your mobile phone or laptop
and join them together as your final submission.</i><br>

The following are some guide questions for you to consider:
<ul>
<li>What blocks/modules/components are designed for the ALU and why are they required?</li>
<li>How are the blocks/modules/components are modelled in VHDL?</li>
<li>How did you test and verify the correctness of your design? How good the coverage (i.e. how many different cases/parts) is your test?</li>
<li>Do you have any work in making your design extensible? e.g. using bit-slicing technique or generic mapping in VHDL</li>
</ul>

<p>You are highly recommended to check the <a href="http://webprojects.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mtang/EBU6335/lab1.html#rubric">rubric</a> for our
assessment of your demonstration videos</p>
