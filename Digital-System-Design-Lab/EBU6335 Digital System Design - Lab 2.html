<h2>Lab 2 - Simple Arithmetic Machine (SAM) Design</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview &amp; Learning Objectives</h3>

<p>The aim of this set of labs is to continue the practice of 
a complete FPGA design cycled - design entry and synthesis,
simulation, implementation and board programming - using the VHDL language and
the designated CAD tools.</p>
<p>You will also work with the modelling of finite state machines (FSM) using
the VHDL language. This will allow you to understand how a bigger problem can be
solved via smaller computation steps.</p>
After completing these experiments you should be able to:
<ul>
<li>Infer and connect sequential blocks, e.g. flip-flops and registers to other
part of your system.</li>
<li>Design and simulate finite state machines (FSM) in VHDL.</li>
<li>Write testbenches to test your FSM.</li>
<li>Implement and download these designs into an FPGA component using CAD tools.</li>
</ul>
<!--
By the end of these four lab sessions you will have the knowledge to build a
medium-sized digital system that solves an arithmetic problem.</p-->

<h3 id="spec">Simple Arithmetic Machine (SAM): Specification</h3>

<p>Simple Arithmetic Machine (SAM) is sequential digital system to compute a
fixed arithmetic functions. The actual function depends on the application and
its complexity varies. When the function is more complicated, generally it takes
longer (i.e. more clock cycles) and more hardware resources (i.e. more logic and
registers) to compute the answer.</p>

<p>In this lab exercise, you are asked to design a 8-bit SAM for exactly two
operands using the VHDL language. 
It has two 8-bit input operands (A and B, both signed), a start control in bit (Start), a
done control bit (Done), an error indicator (Err, optional) and a 8-bit main output (Y). 
A block diagram for the SAM is shown below:</p>
<center><img width="350px" src="./EBU6335 Digital System Design - Lab 2_files/lab2_SAM_block.png"></center>

<p><b>You can assume both A and B are signed numbers represented by 2's complement.</b></p>

<p id="func"><b>Required Function</b><br>
Please enter your BUPT student ID to customise the function for your
SAM (and it will be different from your classmates):</p>
<form>
BUPT ID: <input type="text" id="buptID" size="15" maxlength="10"> 
&nbsp;   <button type="button" name="submit" onclick="genFunc()">Show my function</button> 
</form>

<script>
function genFunc() {
    buptID = document.getElementById("buptID").value;
    if (buptID.length != 10) {
        alert("Please check your BUPT ID!");
        return;
    } else {
        var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
            if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
                document.getElementById("funcText").innerHTML = this.responseText;
            }
        };
        xmlhttp.open("GET", "lab2_sam.php?id=" + buptID, true);
        xmlhttp.send();
    }
}
</script>
<p>Your function is: </p><div id="funcText">Y = (A + B - 1) / 2</div><br>
For the error indicator (Err), it indicates whether the output Y is
numerically incorrect in cases like overflow. The implementation of this signal
is <b>optional</b>.<p></p>

<p>
<b>Quality of your VHDL code:</b> keeping a good structure of your VHDL code (e.g.
consistent identation, proper identifier naming, etc.) and writing concise
comments help you and others to understand the VHDL models and codes more
easily. 
Please spend a minute to check the <a href="http://webprojects.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mtang/EBU6335/lab2.html#rubric">rubric</a> for our
assessment in demonstrations.
</p>

<h3 id="task1">Task 1: To design Finite State Machine (FSM) for the required
function</h3>
<p>
The FSM controls the ALU to carry the right operations by providing function
select signals at different states, so that the final answer of the function can
be computed in the end. To store the immediate value(s) of your calculation, you
may need to add registers to the system in the next task.
</p>
<p>
Study your required function carefully and design an Finite State Machine (FSM)
that calculates it using your own ALU from <a href="http://webprojects.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mtang/EBU6335/lab1.html">Lab 1</a>:
</p>
<p>
<input type="checkbox"> Study the function table of your ALU and work out a list
of steps that calculates the required functions<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Draw a state diagram to show your FSM such that each
step corresponds to a state<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Create a new VHDL module file. In the beginning of the file, write a comment header block with your name in Pinyin and your BUPT student ID. Also mark down the date of modification<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Write the entity for the FSM<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Write the architecture using behaviour modelling technique<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Synthesise the module and fix any errors/mistakes<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Create a testbench and simulate the FSM as "Unit Under
Test (UUT)" to confirm the correctness<br>
</p>

<h3 id="task2">Task 2: To complete the SAM by connecting FSM with ALU</h3>
<p>
Now, you can connect these components together to form the SAM: (i) ALU; (ii)
FSM; (iii) additional register(s) in the top most module, which has been
provided as <tt>SAM.vhd</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<input type="checkbox"> Under the comment header block, enter your name in Pinyin and your BUPT student ID. Also write down the date of modification<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Declare the set of immediate signals that you may need<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Declare the set of components that you may need<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Write statements to create instances of ALU and FSM<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Write statements to infer enough registers<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Write statements to implement any remaining functions (if any)<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Write statements to implement any extra function(s)<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Synthesise the module and fix any errors/mistakes<br>
<input type="checkbox"> Create a testbench and simulate the module to confirm the correctness.<br>
</p>

<h3 id="task4">Task 3: Lab Board Verification</h3>

<p>
Once the synthesis is completed, you can download your design to the board and
verify the correctness.

The input/output devices are mapped to your ALU as shown below:
</p>
<center><img width="700px" src="./EBU6335 Digital System Design - Lab 2_files/lab2_DE10-LITE.png"></center>

<p>Our demonstrators will help you with the working of the lab board.</p>

<h3 id="videodemo">Demonstration Video</h3>
As part of your submission, you need to prepare a video of <b>no longer than 5 minutes</b> 
to demonstrate your design.<br>
The video should contains the following parts:
<ol>
<li>A self introduction - your name, student IDs, our module code and the title
of the lab exercise. <b>Your face must be seen in this part</b>.</li>
<li>The verification on a lab board - exactly 3 different input tests plus any
optional part(s) that you have implemented.</li>
<li>A discussion of your design, referring to your VHDL codes.
You should show your knowledge about the circuit designed.
</li>
</ol>
<i>You can simply record different video clips using your mobile phone or laptop
and join them together as your final submission.</i><br>

The following are some guide questions for you to consider:
<ul>
<li>How is the ALU used to compute the required functions in different steps?</li>
<li>What is your design of the Finite State Machine (FSM)?</li>
<li>How did you test and verify the correctness of your design? How good the coverage (i.e. how many different cases/parts) is your test?</li>
<li>Do you have any work for the optional parts? For example, to determine
possible error conditions of your computation?</li>
</ul>

<p>You are highly recommended to check the <a href="http://webprojects.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mtang/EBU6335/lab2.html#rubric">rubric</a> for our
assessment of your demonstration videos</p>

<!--h3 id="report">Report Writing</h3>
<p>You have to summarise your lab work in a brief report. The report should be
no more than 4 pages A4 (12 pt. font, single spacing) including all figures or
pictures. Please prepare and submit your report in PDF.</p>

<p>The focus of the report is to explain how you design the circuit and apply
VHDL modelling skills in this lab. Also you should discuss how you test (by
simulation) and verify (using lab board).</p-->
